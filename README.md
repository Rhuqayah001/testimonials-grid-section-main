## My process

### Built with

- Built With
- Semantic HTML5
- CSS Grid layout
- Mobile-first responsive design


### What I learned

While building this project, I gained a deeper understanding of the CSS Grid system and how to use its attributes effectively to build a responsive layout. I practiced setting up grid containers, using properties like grid-template-columns, grid-template-areas, and gap, and adjusting layouts based on screen sizes.

I also ensured that the project is fully mobile responsive, adapting the layout seamlessly from mobile to desktop using media queries and the grid system.


Example CSS snippet I used:

.testimonials-grid{
    max-width: 1440px;
    margin: 1rem;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-areas: 
    "item1 item1 item2 item3"
    "item4 item5 item5 item3";
    grid-auto-columns: 1fr;
    gap: 1.5rem;
}

### Continued development

This project helped me understand how to:

Use CSS Grid to create flexible, clean layouts

Adjust grid columns and rows for different screen sizes using media queries

Apply mobile-first design principles to build a responsive and user-friendly layout
